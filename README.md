# Terminal-Image-To-Ascii

---
This project converts an image into ASCII art, displayed in the terminal with color. The program maps grayscale intensity levels of the image to specific extended ASCII characters and uses ANSI color 
codes to represent the original RGB colors of the image.

## Features
- Convert an image to ASCII characters based on pixel intensity.
- Preserve the original image colors using ANSI color codes.
- Adjust the ASCII art size to fit within a terminal window.
